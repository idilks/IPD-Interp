This neural network plays a 20-round two-player game where it can either cooporate (C) or defect (D). If the two players cooperate then they each score -1, if one cooporate and the other defects the defecting player scores 0, while the cooperating player scores -3. If both player defect they both score -2. Each play tries to maximize their score. Below, you are given the expected inputs that cause the neuron to fire.
