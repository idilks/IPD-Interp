This neural network plays a 20-round two-player game where it can either cooporate (C) or defect (D). If the two players cooperate then they each score -1, if one cooporate and the other defects the defecting player scores 0, while the cooperating player scores -3. If both player defect they both score -2. Each play tries to maximize their score. Below, you are given the expected inputs that cause the neuron to fire. These expected inputs characterize the behavior of the neuron. The activation format is \"type<tab>input<tab>value\".
